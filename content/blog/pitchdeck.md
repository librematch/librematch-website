Hello,
We have sent the following document to the people responsible for the Relic Link API in mid-March 2022 to present our project and our goals with the hope of some official support from the maintainers of the Relic Link API.

We believe that this document is also quite useful for the public, as it outlines very well what we envision. Therefore, also for transparency reasons, we would like to make this document available to everyone today.
